"Add Authors Not Users" adds author names to posts and pages without adding them as authors or users on the site.

== Description ==


"Add Authors Not Users" adds author names to posts and pages without adding them as users on the site.
This WordPress plugin adds guest author box to the post dashboard, simplifing the process of adding a guest post.

This plugin is undoubtedly the most simple and straightforward WordPress author plugin to change author functionality by adding author box to WordPress. 
Basically, once installed, users can add the Guest Author Name. It will overwrite the user's name for the specific post and add the guest author to the post.

It is very comfortable because users can add authors without adding users. Registering users can be time consuming especially if you have many guest posts.

While other plugins change author via custom fields, this plugin uses guest author box WordPress to add authors not users to make it very simple to use.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `add-authors-not-users.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place `<?php do_action('plugin_name_hook'); ?>` in your templates
